*DISCLAIMER*: This is some of the ugliest code I've ever written, but I finally get it, and I finally finished!

General function of the code is to be another shell that you can pass arguments to that will specify file behavior regarding 
stdin, stdout, and stderr. The --rdonly flag specified the file to be read from, --wronly to be read from, --verbose to print all following commands, and
--command to use a shell command to operate on the stdin, stdout, and stderr specified (or not; in that case default).

There are also other flags that specify behavior of the shell, such as wait, ignore, etc...

 The process array is dynamically allocated as is the file descriptor array to allow for future 
changes and additions to the code, ie robustness.

The main issue is legibility, and of course it is not as robust as it could be.

Makefile allows for a fundamental check of read only, write only, verbose, and command flags.

The report contains timing information for the bash v. dash v. simpsh tests.
